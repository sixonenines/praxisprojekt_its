        Write a program to create a function that accepts three numbers and finds the largest number 
        along the three numbers. If you have two numbers that are identical and larger than the third number, print out 
        one of the two numbers. Your code should return the output “Largest
        number:” plus the actual number. The datatype must not be queried in advance.
